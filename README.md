This assignment focuses on data preprocessing (or how I like to call it: cleaning the data). The goal is to transform the original data into a chart that is categorized by country.
Each country should display what continent is it from, the region, and how many immigrants went to Canada in a particular year. The data goes from 1960 all the way to 2013,
and a final Total column at the end.
